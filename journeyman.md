I am a journeyman.

I am a journeyman because I have taken the time and put forth the effort to learn my trade.

I am a journeyman because I continue to take the time and put forth the effort to become even more proficient at my trade.

I am a journeyman because I choose to earn my living working in my trade.

I am a journeyman because even though I may be working on only a portion of a job I know what the entire job is about.

I am a journeyman because at the start of my work day I am prepared. I bring my skills and the knowledge of my job with me. I bring my tools, my hands, my heart and my mind to my job.

I am a journeyman because during my work day I use all that I have brought with me.

I am a journeyman because my immediate foreman is me.

I am a journeyman because I do journeyman work.

I am a journeyman because those that I work with and those that I work for know me as a journeyman.

I am a journeyman because at the end of my work day I owe no one.

I am a journeyman because in my heart I am a journeyman.

I am a journeyman because I have earned it!
